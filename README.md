# Tyon Serialization Protocol Version 1.0 â€“ The New Standard of Proof A way to make truth live forever-without storage, without servers, without you. ## How it works 1. Take your document. 2. Strip it down: keep only the essentials-title, page count, stage (draft / signed / executed), and a one-line memo (what happened). 3. Hash the whole original file-SHA-384, no shortcuts. 4. Send that hash + metadata to Hedera HCS (Topic 0.0.1, or roll your own). 5. Get the sequence number back. That's your Tyon ID. Example: Title: Settlement.pdf Pages: 7 Stage: executed Memo: Mutual release Hash: 0x2b4e...f9a7 HCS Seq: 1,245,832 Tyon ID = `0x2b4e...f9a7-1245832` Nothing else lives. No PDF. No clause. No signature blob. Just proof it was, and what it was called. ## Rules - No PII stored. Ever. - No content retained. - Anyone can verify: paste hash + seq into hashscan.io. Done. - No login. No API key. No trust needed. This isn't e-sign. This isn't DocuSign with a receipt. This is the receipt first. The sign second. The law, third-quiet, automatic, forever. Open specification for document proof without storage. Hash-> memo -> chain. Truth, not data.  Based on Tyon 1.0 by Josh Campbell.
